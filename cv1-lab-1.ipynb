    "\n",
    "In this section, we delve into the photometric stereo technique, a method used to reconstruct a surface's shape from a set of images captured under varying lighting conditions. This approach is based on the principles outlined in Section 5.4 of Forsyth and Ponce's *Computer Vision: A Modern Approach*, which provides a comprehensive introduction to the theory and application of photometric stereo in computer vision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Photometric stereo is particularly useful for capturing fine details of surface geometry. The core idea is to utilize an orthographic camera to take multiple images of a surface, each under different lighting conditions. By analyzing the variations in image intensity across these images, we can infer the surface normals and, subsequently, reconstruct the surface's height at each pixel, leading to what is commonly known as a height map or depth map.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method assumes that the camera and the surface remain stationary, with illumination coming from different directions. By capturing enough images with different light source vectors, we can solve for the surface normals and albedo at each pixel."
